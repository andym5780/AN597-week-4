## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Zombies[3]
```{r}

psh <- psh + xlab("age") + ylab("height")

psh <- psh + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())  
psh

psw <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = weight))  
psw <- psw + xlab("age") + ylab("weight")  
psw <- psw + geom_point()  
psw <- psw + theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())

```
The variable of hight andand weight to age both seem to be related. As age increases so does height. It looks like a positive linear coralation.  

#Zombie[4]
```{r}
minh <- min(d$height)
minh

maxh <- max(d$height)
maxh
```
here I took the min and hax for height so I could make my histograms
```{r}
qqnorm(d$height, main="normal QQ plot for height")
qqline(d$height, col="blue")
hist(d$height, breaks = seq(from =50, to =100, by=5), probability= TRUE)
```
The distrabutioin above for height looks normal
```{r}
minw <- min(d$weight)
minw

maxw <- max(d$weight)
maxw
```
```{r}
qqnorm(d$weight, main="normal QQ plot for weight")
qqline(d$weight, col="blue")
hist(d$weight, breaks = seq(from =80, to =250, by=5), probability= TRUE)
```
The distrabutioin above for weight looks normal

```{r}

qqnorm(d$age, main="normal QQ plot for age")
